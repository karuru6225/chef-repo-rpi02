#	with secondary channel below the primary channel
#	(20 MHz only if neither is set)
#	Note: There are limits on which channels can be used with HT40- and

#	HT40- and HT40+ use per IEEE 802.11n Annex J:
#	freq		HT40-		HT40+
#	2.4 GHz		5-13		1-7 (1-9 in Europe/Japan)
#	5 GHz		40,48,56,64	36,44,52,60
#	(depending on the location, not all of these channels may be available
#	for use)
#	Please note that 40 MHz channels may switch their primary and secondary
#	channels if needed or creation of 40 MHz channel maybe rejected based
#	on overlapping BSSes. These changes are done automatically when hostapd
#	is setting up the 40 MHz channel.
